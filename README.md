# pyannote-audio

Neural building blocks for speaker diarization: 
* speech activity detection
* speaker change detection
* overlapped speech detection
* speaker embedding
* speaker diarization pipeline

# install from source in the "develop" branch
$ git clone https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio.git
$ cd pyannote-audio
$ git checkout develop
$ pip install .
```

## Documentation

Part of the API is described in [this](tutorials/models/pretrained) tutorial.  
Other than that, there is still a lot to do (contribute?) documentation-wise...
