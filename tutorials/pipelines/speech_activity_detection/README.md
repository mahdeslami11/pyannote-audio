# Speech activity detection pipeline with `pyannote.audio`

Training a model for speech activity detection is not enough to get actual speech activity detection results. One has to also tune detection thresholds (and other optional pipeline hyper-parameters).

This tutorial assumes that you have already followed the [data preparation](../../data_preparation) tutorial, and teaches how to optimize a speech activity detection pipeline using `pyannote-pipeline` command line tool.

For simplicity, we will use a pretrained speech activity detection model.

## Raw scores extraction
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

This tutorial relies on a speech activity detection model pretrained on AMI dataset - but you could (should?) obviously use a locally [trained](../../models/speech_activity_detection) or [fine-tuned](../../finetune) model.

We start by extracting raw scores using `sad_ami` pretrained model:

```bash
$ export EXP_DIR=tutorials/pipelines/speech_activity_detection
$ for SUBSET in development test
 > do
 > pyannote-audio sad apply --pretrained=sad_ami --subset=${SUBSET} ${EXP_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
 > done
```

Note that this is a good idea to also run this command on the `test` subset if you want to later apply the trained pipeline on them.

## Configuration
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

To ensure reproducibility, `pyannote-pipeline` relies on a configuration file defining the experimental setup:

```bash
$ cat ${EXP_DIR}/config.yml
```
```yaml
pipeline:
   name: pyannote.audio.pipeline.speech_activity_detection.SpeechActivityDetection
   params:
      # replace {{EXP_DIR}} by its actual value
      precomputed: {{EXP_DIR}}/sad_ami
      
freeze:
  pad_onset: 0.0
  pad_offset: 0.0
```

This configuration file tells the pipeline to use raw speech activity detection scores that we just extracted. It also freezes two hyper-parameters that we choose not to optimize.

## Training
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

The following command will run hyper-parameter optimization on the development subset of the AMI database. One can run it multiple times in parallel to speed things up.

```bash
$ pyannote-pipeline train --subset=development --forever ${EXP_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
```

Note that we use the `development` subset for optimizing the pipeline hper-parameters because the `train` subset has usually already been used for training the model itself.

This will create a bunch of files in `TRN_DIR`, including `params.yml` that contains the (so far) optimal parameters.

```bash
$ export TRN_DIR=${EXP_DIR}/train/AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset.development
$ cat ${TRN_DIR}/params.yml
```
```yaml
loss: 0.05652217656927686
params:
  min_duration_off: 0.6315121069334447
  min_duration_on: 0.0007366523493967721
  offset: 0.5727193137037349
  onset: 0.5842225805454029
  pad_offset: 0.0
  pad_onset: 0.0
```

The `loss:` value actually corresponds to the metric that is currently being optimized. For the speech activity detection pipeline, the loss is the detection error rate. See `pyannote.audio.pipeline.speech_activity_detection.SpeechActivityDetection` docstring for details about the `params:` section.

Note that the actual content of your `params.yml` might vary because the optimisation process is not deterministic: the longer you wait, the better it gets. We ran the optimization overnight to get `loss` down to 5.6%.

There is no easy way to decide if/when the optimization has converged to the optimal setting. The `pyannote-pipeline train` command will run forever, looking for a better set of hyper-parameters. 

## Application
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

The optimized pipeline can then be applied on the `test` subset (as long as you also extracted correspond raw scores):

```bash
$ pyannote-pipeline apply --subset=test ${TRN_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
```

This will create a bunch of files in `${TRN_DIR}/apply/latest` subdirectory, including 
* `AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset.test.rttm` that contains the actual output of the optimized pipeline
* `AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset.test.eval` that provides an evaluation of the result (more or less equivalent to what you would get by using `pyannote.metrics` command line tool).

This pipeline reaches 6.0x% detection error rate on the test set:

```bash
$ pyannote-metrics detection AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset ${TRN_DIR}/apply/latest/AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset.test.rttm
```
```
