# Feature extraction with `pyannote.audio`

In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform feature extraction using `pyannote-speech-feature` command line tool.

It is assumed that you have already followed the [data preparation](../../data_preparation) tutorial.

## Configuration
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

To ensure reproducibility, `pyannote-speech-feature` relies on a configuration file defining the experimental setup:

```bash
$ cat tutorials/feature-extraction/config.yml
feature_extraction:
   name: LibrosaMFCC                # extract MFCCs using Librosa
   params:
      e: False                      # no energy
      De: True                      # energy 1st derivative
      DDe: True                     # energy 2nd derivative
      coefs: 19                     # 19 coefficients
      D: True                       # with 1st derivatives
      DD: True                      # and 2nd derivatives
      duration: 0.025               # one 25ms-long windows
      step: 0.010                   # and a step of 10ms
      sample_rate: 16000
```

## Extraction
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

The following command will extract features for all files of the `MixHeadset` protocol of the AMI database.

```bash
$ export EXPERIMENT_DIR=tutorials/feature_extraction
$ pyannote-speech-feature ${EXPERIMENT_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
Development set: 21it [01:28,  4.21s/it]
Test set: 22it [01:39,  4.53s/it]
Training set: 115it [09:33,  4.99s/it]
```

This will create one a bunch of files in `EXPERIMENT_DIR`.
```bash
$ ls $EXPERIMENT_DIR
AMI config.yml metadata.yml
$ ls $EXPERIMENT_DIR/AMI | head -n 5
EN2001a.Mix-Headset.npy
EN2001b.Mix-Headset.npy
EN2001d.Mix-Headset.npy
EN2001e.Mix-Headset.npy
EN2002b.Mix-Headset.npy
```

## Usage
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))


```python
>>> from pyannote.audio.features import Precomputed
>>> precomputed = Precomputed('tutorials/feature_extraction')
>>> from pyannote.database import get_protocol
>>> protocol = get_protocol('AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset')
>>> for current_file in protocol.test():
...     features = precomputed(current_file)
...     break
>>> X = features.data                   # numpy array containing all features
>>> X.shape
(178685, 59)
>>> from pyannote.core import Segment
>>> features.crop(Segment(10.2, 11.4))  # numpy array containing local features
array([[ 0.85389346,  0.71583151,  0.71233984, ..., -0.89612021,
