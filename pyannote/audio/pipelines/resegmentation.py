class Resegmentation(Pipeline):
    """Resegmentation pipeline

    This pipeline relies on a pretrained segmentation model to improve an existing diarization
    hypothesis. Resegmentation is done locally by sliding the segmentation model over the whole
    file. For each position of the sliding window, we find the optimal mapping between the input
    diarization and the output of the segmentation model and permutate the latter accordingly.
    Permutated local segmentations scores are then aggregated over time and postprocessed using
    hysteresis thresholding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    segmentation : Model, str, or dict, optional
        Pretrained segmentation model. Defaults to "pyannote/Segmentation-PyanNet-DIHARD".
        See pyannote.audio.pipelines.utils.get_model for supported format.
    diarization : str, optional
        File key to use as input diarization. Defaults to "diarization".

    Hyper-parameters
    ----------------
    onset, offset : float
        Onset/offset detection thresholds
    min_duration_on : float
        Remove speaker turn shorter than that many seconds.
    min_duration_off : float
        Fill same-speaker gaps shorter than that many seconds.
